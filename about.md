## What I Do
I'm a PhD student in the Dept of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT. I work in the [Neuroscience Statistics Research Lab](http://www.neurostat.mit.edu/) with Dr. Emery Brown at MIT and the [Neuroimaging in Coma and Consciousness Lab](http://www.massgeneral.org/neurology/research/researchlab.aspx?id=1605) with Dr. Brian Edlow at Massachusetts General Hospital. My work is on mechanisms and interpretations of brain signals in health and disease.

I'm based in Boston, MA.

## What Else I Do
My other interests are in clinical neurotechnology and signal processing for algotrading. I once created [a Tumblr](http://microaggressions.com) that put [this word](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/microaggression) into the Merriam-Webster dictionary.
