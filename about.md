## What I Do
I'm a PhD student in the Dept of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT. My research is in systems-level mechanisms of general anesthesia and coma. My main research methods are EEG and structural MRI in clinical populations. I'm based in Boston, MA.

## What Else I Do
Not much! I used to run [a site](http://microaggressions.com) that put [this word](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/microaggression) into the Merriam-Webster dictionary. These days, I do some hiking and also struggle to write.
