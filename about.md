## What I Do
I'm a PhD student in the Dept of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT. I work in the [Neuroscience Statistics Research Lab](http://www.neurostat.mit.edu/) at MIT and the [Neuroimaging in Coma and Consciousness Lab](http://www.massgeneral.org/neurology/research/researchlab.aspx?id=1605) at Massachusetts General Hospital. My current topic of study is the mechanisms of brain arousal during general anesthesia and coma. My methods include electroencephalographic and electrophysiological recordings, and structural magnetic resonance imaging in clinical populations.

I'm based in Boston, MA.

## What Else I Do
My other long-term interests (outside of basic science and my academic work) include neurotechnology and quantitative finance. I used to run [a site](http://microaggressions.com) that put [this word](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/microaggression) into the Merriam-Webster dictionary. These days, I do some hiking and also struggle to write.
