I heard from Twitter that you can make these nifty static pages with Github Pages and Jekyll. So I searched a while for a nice theme that I'd be comfortable putting all of my personal stuff on for the world to see. And voila.

The thing with web presence these days is that there are so many places. Between the different social media sites and hosts for my digital selves, I've struggled to come up with a system for all of it. So that professional connections are not deluged with personal ramblings and close friends are not bored by the minutiae of my scientific endeavors. What I came up with was: Twitter for current thoughts, Facebook for personal things, the rest for my "public" self. What is that anyway? I was never clear about what to put on my own site. I think this is a blog? But I'll try to keep from editorializing on this site (I'll probably use Medium for that) and instead restrict this content to projects I'm working on.

I named this site neurosignals because signal processing and neuroscience encompasses so much of what I do and learn to do these days.
